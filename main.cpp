// [x]  Do the stack_top stuff soon or else you'll need to do it for everything
//      like last time and you'll make a mistake.
// [x]  Actually setup the reading from a source file instead of using a String
//      to pass source code.
// [ ]  Fix issue where something can't be deleted because it was never allocated.
